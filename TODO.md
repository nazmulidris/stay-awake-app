# Next steps

- Integrate Maret's new designs into the MainActivity (create new styles)

# Project goals

- Build an app for Android N and O that allows designers and developers to keep their phones awake
  while doing their work.
- To save battery and for security, a lot of devices turn their screens off in about 10 minutes.
  This app extends that period indefinitely, as long as their phones are charging.
- This app uses Quick Settings Tiles (that were available for Android N).
